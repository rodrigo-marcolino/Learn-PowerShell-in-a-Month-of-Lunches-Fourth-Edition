## 1. Make a one-to-one connection with a remote computer (or with localhost if you have only one computer). Launch your favorite text editor. What happens?
___
## 2. Using `Invoke-ScriptBlock`, retrieve a list of processes currently running from one or two remote computers (it’s okay to use `localhost` twice if you have only one computer). Format the results as a wide list. (Hint: It’s okay to retrieve results and have the formatting occur on your computer—don’t include the `Format-` cmdlets in the commands that are invoked remotely.)
